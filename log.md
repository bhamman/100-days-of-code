# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: May 1, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started 100 days of code and deliberate practice!

**Thoughts:** I started the Javascript section of FCC and noticed Javascript is very similar to C++. I completed variables, strings, arrays, and started functions.
I started working on the HTML5 and CSS portion of FCC. Going through all the tags and elements was a good review for the final that is coming up in my web design class. One thing I learned was that one element can have more than one class. I also liked the way they explained padding and margins, it was clear and easier to understand. I completed the HTML5 and CSS portion of FCC. 


### Day 1: May 2, 2017 (Example 2)

**Today's Progress**: Completed Responsive Design with Bootstrap and started jQuery.

**Thoughts**: I enjoyed learning about bootstrap and seeing the ways it can make webpages look nice for any device. There are limitless uses for bootstrap. I didn't go farther because I got stuck on the first jQuery challenge, Learn how Script Tags and Document Ready Work. I am not sure what I was doing wrong but I think it had to do with opening and closing the script elements. I was getting frustrated because FCC does not tell you if you're wrong. I know it gives you a check mark for each challenge you complete but when I hit the run test button it seemed like nothing happened because my code was wrong. I'm going to do some research on jQuery so I can knock out that section tomorrow.  



### Day 2: May 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Almost finished the Javascript section!

**Thoughts** I had to skip the last challenge dealing with objects. I'm not sure how to call an object array element and what I was trying to do was not working. I found it a little difficult to learn and understand these objects. They are not so different in C++ but Javascript has nested objects? I will have to go through the Javascript objects section again to see if I can figure it out.
